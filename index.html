        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="bonus-part-1">
            <p>People working with Practical Action, an international development charity in Bangladesh has been deeply
                affected by record breaking floods.

                Thousands of families have lost everything after flood water inundated crops and killed livestock after
                the monsoons struck with unusual force in the Sylhet region of the country.

                Those affected included more than 23,000 families involved in Practical Actionâ€™s Accelerated Sanitation
                and Water for All project, which had just been completed.

                Damaged infrastructure included roads, schools, houses and offices, as well as the Practical Action
                office in Sylhet were also affected.

                The flooding also caused power cuts, which broke down communication within and across communities and
                also affected their ability to receive safe drinking water, access to sanitation, and essentials such as
                food and medicine.

                17 schools and three community clinics are badly affected. About 23,220 toilets, 18,248 hand washing
                devices and 5,930 water options have been divested by this flood. Households will require support to
                rebuild their houses and latrines, after the rainy season.</p>
